<h2><ins>Task 1:Introducing LAN Topologies</ins></h2><br>
1.<b>"LAN"</b> stands for Local Area Network<br><br>
Answer: Local Area Network <br><br><br>
2.Router functions for <b>routing</b> the network.<br><br>
Answer: routing<br><br><br>
3. Switch is used to connect the local devices to other location or nodes. <br><br>
Answer: Switch <br><br><br>
4. Best efficient topology to set up is <b>Bus Topology</b> due to it's simplicity. It requires less cable length<br><br>
Answer: Bus topology <br><br><br>
5. Most expensive and hard to maintain topology is <b>Star Topology</b> as it requires extra length of cable and extra hardware such as switch. <br><br>
Answer: Star Topology <br><br><br>
6. Click on the view site on task 1 and follow the step! At the end it will ask you to spamm the request and break down the bus topology.<br>
Once you done that, you will get a THM Flag. It means bus topology is not that reliable as if there is many request in the topology.<br><br>
Answer: THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}<br><br><br>
