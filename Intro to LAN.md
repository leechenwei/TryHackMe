<h1><ins>Intro to LAN</ins></h1><br><br>

<h2><ins>Task 1:Introducing LAN Topologies</ins></h2><br>
1.<b>"LAN"</b> stands for Local Area Network<br><br>
Answer: Local Area Network <br><br><br>
2.Router functions for <b>routing</b> the network.<br><br>
Answer: routing<br><br><br>
3. Switch is used to connect the local devices to other location or nodes. <br><br>
Answer: Switch <br><br><br>
4. Best efficient topology to set up is <b>Bus Topology</b> due to it's simplicity. It requires less cable length<br><br>
Answer: Bus topology <br><br><br>
5. Most expensive and hard to maintain topology is <b>Star Topology</b> as it requires extra length of cable and extra hardware such as switch. <br><br>
Answer: Star Topology <br><br><br>
6. Click on the view site on task 1 and follow the step! At the end it will ask you to spamm the request and break down the bus topology.<br>
Once you done that, you will get a THM Flag. It means bus topology is not that reliable as if there is many request in the topology.<br><br>
Answer: THM{TOPOLOGY_FLAWS}<br><br><br>

<h2><ins>Task 2:A Primer on Subnetting</ins></h2><br>
1. Dividing a network up into smaller pieces or few nodes are known as <b>"Subnetting"</b><br><br>
Answer: Subnetting<br><br><br>
2. 32 bits in a subnet mask.<br><br>
Answer: 32 <br><br><br>
3. 0-255 is the range of a octet in a subnet mask. <br><br>
Answer: 0-255<br><br><br>
4. The start of the network of subnet mask can be identified as <b>Network Address</b><br><br>
Answer: Network Address <br><br><br>
5. To determine the address of local devices is known as <b>Host Address</b><br><br>
Answer: Host Address<br><br><br>
6. Used to send the information to other network is known as <b>Default Gateway</b>.Pretend as the host if no IP found in the network to receive the data.<br><br>
Answer: Default Gateway <br><br><br>
